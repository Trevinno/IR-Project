# This directory was made to be able to include all the logic to running the core of the application

The first step you would want to do is to create a python virtual enviroment like pyenv, you could 
do this with a command like: python -m venv venv

After creating the virtual enviroment you can install the dependencies with a command like: pip install -r requirements.txt

The logic in this module is called by the Flask backend, so there is no need to run the code directly from here
