# Welcome to the wonderful IR Group 100 Repo ðŸ˜ƒ

This repo contains the implementation for Assignment II for the module Information Retrival.
The project consists of using BM25 with conjunction of BERT word embeddings to conduct get a relevant search of food recipies.
The dataset we will we working with is found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions.
